This program is a very basic 4 function calculator.
Realistically, this is pretty unnecessary since RCA BASIC3, like most BASICS, already has math functions built in and can just print the results. It can even do many scientific calculations by default too.
I mostly made this as a challenge and because I felt like I have been neglecting RCA BASIC3 for a bit too long.
It's very clunky to use since it requires inputting a number, then the math function, then the next number.
It does let you keep going but it makes you enter the letter C in order to keep doing more math.

I originally had a much more complicated version that involved having two more variables, C and D that I later realized were completely unnecessary.
That helped me shorten the program by almost half of its original length.
It's still not ideal since it's bunch of IF statements but my understandings of programming and RCA BASIC3 are still pretty rudimentary.
I'm still mostly happy with the results though.

This code was originally written by me.
The Simple Calculator old version folder is the older and longer version of this program that I am keeping around just for my own purposes of documenting my progress.
