This program is a very basic 4 function calculator.
Realistically, this is pretty unnecessary since RCA BASIC3, like most BASICS, already has math functions built in and can just print the results. It can even do many scientific calculations by default too.
I mostly made this as a challenge and because I felt like I have been neglecting RCA BASIC3 for a bit too long.
It's very clunky to use since it requires inputting a number, then the math function, then the next number.
It does let you keep going but it makes you enter the letter C in order to keep doing more math.
I probably could have made it just do it by default which would have saved some code and been a bit more intuitive, but I wanted to have some way of exiting the program that wasn't just purposefully entering something that isn't a number and erroring the program out.
I might return to this one day and try to make something more efficient that is filled with less spaghetti code but as it is I'm fine with it.

This progam was originally made by me.
