This program was provided to me in a PLOAD format by Marcel von Tongeren, another member of the COSMAC ELF groups.io forum who is also one of the people contributing to the Emma02 emulator project.
It was originally written in Super Basic for the COSMAC ELF and was able to run without any modifications on my part.
This program procedurally generates haikus from a list of words stored in the program as data.
Very interesting early example of rudimentary ai experiments.
I will admit, the actual inner workings of this program is quite a bit above my skill level so I'm glad it was able to run just fine.
The only modification I made was adding an extra line at the beginning that specifies you need to type QUIT after a haiku is generated in order to exit the program.

This program was recovered from cassette tapes provided by Herb Johnson, see http://www.retrotechnology.com/restore/elfII_vcf.html for details about the related recovery project.

The original Super Basic version is also present on the Emma02 emulator github found at https://github.com/etxmato/emma_02.
