This is a simple rock paper scissors program I designed myself just using a simple random number generator and an input by the user.
This is also techinically the first proper program/game I've created for the MemberCHIP card and RCA BASIC3, not counting the coin flipper program I made before this.
The code for this program was originally made by me and not adapted from any other sources.
