For some backstory, I'm currently trying to learn C while also experimenting with RCA BASIC3 and Lee Hart's various 1802 based computer kits.
Specifically, I am using K N King's C Programming: A Modern Approach to learn C.
That book has several different programming projects at the end of each chapter, and one of the projects is to create a program to calculate the volume of a sphere using a radius input by the user.
Since it's such a simple program, I thought I might as well translate it to RCA BASIC3, and honestly making this program was a bit easier in BASIC.
Like many of the programs I have made myself, it's very simple but it is a part of my learning process. Plus it also helps me in my goal to build a repository of known working RCA BASIC3 programs.

This program was originally written by me.
