This program was provided to me in a PLOAD format by Marcel von Tongeren, another member of the COSMAC ELF groups.io forum who is also one of the people contributing to the Emma02 emulator project.
It was originally written in Super Basic for the COSMAC ELF and luckily it is able to run on the MemberCHIP card without any modifications, likely due to the fact this programs is mostly math functions which tend to be pretty universal in various dialects of BASIC.
This program is designed to do calculations for acid/base titrations in a chemistry class .As near as I can tell, the program works fine, but I must admit it has been a long time since I have done any titration caclulations so I am not able to truly test the program with any reasonable numbers that would have actually been input into the program.

This program was recovered from cassette tapes provided by Herb Johnson, see http://www.retrotechnology.com/restore/elfII_vcf.html for details about the related recovery project.
