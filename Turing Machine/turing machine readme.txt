This program was provided to me in a PLOAD format by Marcel von Tongeren, another member of the COSMAC ELF groups.io forum who is also one of the people contributing to the Emma02 emulator project.

It was originally written in Super Basic for the COSMAC ELF and was able to run without any modifications on my part.

This program is designed to simulate a Turing Machine.

I will admit that I have not fully used or tested this program as I do not have any experience with Turing Machine simulations but from what little I have tested, it seemed to work.

However, it should be noted that this program is not fully tested and may not work without issue.

The only modifications I made were some edits to the input questions to clarify what exact characters you need to enter.

This program was recovered from cassette tapes provided by Herb Johnson, see http://www.retrotechnology.com/restore/elfII_vcf.html for details about the related recovery project.

The original Super Basic version is also present on the Emma02 emulator github found at https://github.com/etxmato/emma_02.
